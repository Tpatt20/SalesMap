# What is SalesMap?

In SigmaTEK, the problem with the current Sales Map (defining what sales representatives are responsible for what regions) is that it is changed often. Too often. And every revision requires someone to make an entirely new map which takes ages. This program seeks to change that so that AE's always have the most up-to-date contact information for a sales rep for a customer's area.

###### Currently, if you have to look up a customer's sales rep, this is the process you have to go through:

1. Look in Help Desk for where they are located (if it's not open already)
2. Google what that state/region looks like (if you don't remember- like me sometimes)
3. Find it in the map
4. Find the sales rep name that is closest to that state/region and share's that state/region's color
5. Look up that sales rep's contact info
6. Give it to the customer

###### With this program, here are the steps:

1. Look in Help Desk for where they are located (if it's not open already)
2. Select the state/region from the dropdown
3. Give the information to the customer

This program allows you to search for a sales representative by name or by region (each from their own drop-down menu). Each of these will provide the contact information for that/those sales representative(s). This app will also automatically update its own databases (provided that "Check for updates on startup" is checked- which it is by default) *[This database information will be as up-to-date as possible. If there is ever a discrepency, please let me (Derek Antrican) know so that I might hunt down the correct information]*
